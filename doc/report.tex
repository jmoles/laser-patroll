% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.

\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}

\usepackage{url}
\usepackage{pgfplots}  % Used to produce graphs.
\usepackage{pgfplotstable} % Used to make graphs from reading tables.
\usepackage{datatool}  % Used to read CSV and make simple table.



% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as

\IEEEPARstart{S}{orting} is an important task that is often performed on sets of data. This report discusses the work done by Laser Patroll (sic) for a team project at Portland State University for the course ECE 588. The project was focused around sorting a list of arbitrary elements through various methods and benchmarking each of the algorithms against each other. The four algorithms benchmarked and discussed in this report the C++ std::sort, Quick Sort~\cite{Hoare1961}~\cite{Hoare1962}, Merge Sort~\cite{Knuth:1998:ACP:280635}, and Bitonic Sort~\cite{Batcher1968}. In this report, we present an overview of the sorting algorithms in Section~\ref{sec:sorting}, the C++ testing framework designed to check the sorted data and gather results in Section~\ref{sec:testing}, and the results of the four algorithms in Section~\ref{sec:results}.

%TODO: Talk about how we picked these algorithms.

% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)


\section{Sorting Algorithms}
\label{sec:sorting}
This section will discuss the four sorting algorithms run.

\subsection{Basic Sort}
%TODO: Expand std::sort description. It apparently uses a introspective sort and heapsort, maybe? Should cite.
Basic sort was implemented by simply passing the data array to \texttt{std::sort}. In no case was it executed in a parallel fashion.

\subsection{Quick Sort}
%TODO: Put diagram for this sort.
%TODO: Talk about how data was split for threading.

\subsection{Merge Sort}
%TODO: Put diagram for this sort.
%TODO: Talk about how data was split for threading.

\subsection{Bitonic Sort}
%TODO: Put diagram for this sort.
%TODO: Talk about how data was split for threading.

\section{Testing Framework}
\label{sec:testing}

C++ was selected as the language to implement the testing framework and all the sorting algorithms because of the relative ease and ubiquity of tools to compile for the language. The framework had the following objectives for its design:

\begin{itemize}
\item A common path to benchmark each function to ensure timing is measured consistently.
\item Re-usability of common tasks between the sort algorithms.
\item Common call to a Sort function allow blind usage of sort only passing the number of threads and a vector of data.
\item Ability to swap object that data for sorting was stored in easily.
\end{itemize}

%TODO: Figure
These goals were accomplished through an object oriented set of classes. A common \texttt{SortCommon} class was the parent of all the sort algorithms and contained the means to benchmark an algorithm, generate an unsorted data vector, check if a given set of data is sorted or not, divide set of data using domain decomposition, merging, and padding (used by Bitonic). Each of the sort functions were free to do the sort by any reasonable means necessary. The requirements were that the only two inputs the Sort gets is a set of data and the number of threads it is allowed to divide the data up across. Figure XX shows the layout of these classes and the overall framework.

The algorithm was to sort the data in place (or at least modify the pointer to the new set of data) so that the benchmark function can then validate that the data was sorted. All four of the algorithms did the sort in place (modified the passed in data directly) or created a ``destination'' data set and then swapped the pointer of the two at the end. Memory utilization can become an issue with sets of data this large so copying or making copies of large subsets of the data was not performed in the algorithms.

C++'s \texttt{std::vector} filled with \texttt{unsigned int} was used as the storage object and data type for each of the algorithms. A \texttt{std::vector} is an efficient, dynamically linked list that was selected over an array for the ability to have an easily growing and shrinking memory space (in case an algorithm selected to do an operation involving such a task). We also feel that the C++ compiler can do a better job optimizing the use of a \texttt{std::vector} in our code compared to the relatively manual task of memory management in an array.

The benchmark function prepared a given set of data to pass to the virtual \texttt{Sort} function implemented by each algorithm. The benchmark function also verified that the data was actually sorted when the \texttt{Sort} function returned. The function only ran the timer for a benchmark of an algorithm during the \texttt{Sort} call portion of the testing. This was done to ensure that any overhead tasks performed by the benchmark function itself does not add to the time a given sort runs.

Data could be generated in a few different patterns depending on the type of sort desired for benchmarking. The three options available were a set of data that is actually in order, a set of data that is in complete reverse, and a set of data that was completely random. The first two were used primarily for verification and testing of aspects of the algorithm. The third (random) set of data was used for all testing shown Section~\ref{sec:results} of the report.

The data was checked for sorting using a single-threaded function to look through the elements. The function simply started at the front of the data and moved through all of the elements. If it found an element that was greater than the previous element (in other words, not sorted), the function would multiply the time it took for the sort to run by $-1$ and print a warning stating that the data was not sorted.

A few other other utility functions were also in the \texttt{SortCommon} class. A function that would take the length of the data and how many threads to divide the work amongst would return a \texttt{std::vector} containing a \texttt{std::pair} of the minimum and maximum index for a given thread to perform the sorting on. Bitonic and quick sort used this in the functional decomposition of the data, but merge used its own algorithm. For bitonic, the data and the number of threads had to be a power of two without modification. A padding and unpadding function is also added to pad zeros to the data in the event the user requests a sort on data that does not meet the power of two requirement for bitonic.

% TODO: Add valgrind citation, listing, and note about what the results mean.
The code was also checked with valgrind to verify that there were no memory leaks. Listing XX shows the output from valgrind.

GitHub was also used for revision control. This entire project is available for download at \url{http://github.com/jmoles/laser-patroll/}. Doxygen is also commented in-line to generate a set of HTML and PDF documentation for the project.

%TODO: Mention:

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
%TODO: Things to mention.
% - Bitonic time with padding if not power of two.
% - Add the four charts that were shown in the presentation.

This section provides the results for the tests of the algorithms. Two different types of tests will be presented. The first is showing the amount of time it took each algorithm to sort with a varying number of threads and constant data size. The other shows the total time all four algorithms took to execute and then percentage of that total time that each algorithm took to run plotting for a constant number of threads and a varying data size.

It is important to note that throughout all of these tests, anything labeled as ``basic'' is \texttt{std::sort} running in a \textbf{serial} fashion. We did not wrap any parallelization around \texttt{std::sort} so that each of the algorithms are evaluated against the sort that would likely be used in C++.

The first series are in Figure~\ref{fig:tvtlg} for a data set of size 134,217,728 elements and Figure~\ref{fig:tvtsm} for a data set of size 512 elements. These tests aimed to see how each algorithm performs with an increasing number of threads both with a small set of data and a large set of data. Ideally, each algorithm should get faster as the number of threads it has available to perform work increases.

% TODO: Why does quick sort do what it does?
Looking first at the large data set, merge sort follows the ideal situation quite well and starts to reach a limit in execution time as it gets to the end. Quick sort seems fairly flat over the execution regardless of the number of threads allocated to it. This could be a results of the domain decomposition model of splitting up the work and bringing it back together. As the number of threads increases, there is a final merge that only merges two sets of data at a time. This could result in this final merge occupying more time. 

Bitonic is affected by the same merge issue; however, it has another factor slowing it down. Bitonic shows an average trend of decreasing execution time, but it is susceptible to the requirement that the data and threads must be a power of two. As a result, bitonic performs the best on the situations where the number of threads is a power of two and begins to slow down as it increases from a power of two, peaking one value right before the next power of two.  
%TODO: Small data execution results for size.
%TODO: Single threaded case is missing on the plot.
